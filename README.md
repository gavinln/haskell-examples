# Haskell examples

This repository has multiple Haskell example programs from different sources
including Haskell books, videos, blog posts and other tutorials.

## Program in Haskell

The book [Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton][100] is one of the best
resources in learning Haskell.

[100]: https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229/

### Setup the environment

1. Follow the instructions in the "Nix and Haskell" section and it will install
   ghci. It does not install stack.

2. Start ghci


#### Install Stack

[Stack][200] is a cross-platform tool for developing Haskell projects.

[200]: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

1. Install Stack
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

## Tips

1. Use -fdefer-type-errors in ghci so errors become warnings when experimenting
